## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use basic properties of Styled components to reduce code such as passing props to my button components in order to help reduce the amount of code I have to write in order to style my buttons.

I learned how to use the React context api to manage global state in my application.

React router has also been an amazing tool that's really helped me during this project. I learned how to dynamically render components by using routes and hooks such as useParams. Also react router helps components to render without any flashes of white screen or page reload, unlike typical href links.

I also learned how to navigate through a nested JSON file to get the data that I want and to properly display it as needed.

I also learned how to make a custom select menu to match the design provided.

### Continued development

- I think it would be interesting to add transitions to the menu on mobile so that it slides out from the right.

### Useful resources

- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced) - This resource helped me to understand how to apply different styles to the same element without typing the same code over and over again.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
